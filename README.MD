# P2P Auction

Here not finished example of P2P Auction based on Hyperswarm.

## Problems

- [ ] DB implementation wrong. One user should have one db and initialization of db should be only once for user.
- [ ] No logic for Auction, only RPC commands
- [ ] Because of db init issues will better refactor it or reimplement
- [ ] No tests

Please, not use this example even for education.

## Summary

Test was not passed.
On start of task I was concentrate on small details of implementation,
as result you can see that I tried to make it good but this is not work as expected.

I think will better rework this example because current state of code difficult for refactor.
This can take time, so, I will provide this code as final result, but I not think that this is good.

Feliz Ano Novo galera! (Happy New Year guys!)

Please let me know about results because after I'll remove this repo.
